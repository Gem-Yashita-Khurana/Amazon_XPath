Q : Why do we need axes method to create Xpaths?

Ans : Xpath axes are used to search for multiple nodes in the XML document from the current node context.
These methods are mainly used when the web element is not identified with the help of ID, name, class name, link text, CSS selector and XPath, etc.
Some XPath axes which are commonly used to identify the web element through XPath are child,parent,following,preceding,descendant etc.
